      <img src="https://www.sodhatravel.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Thali.jpg?width=900&name=Thali.jpg">
      <p class="special_para">Thali is more than a meal; it is an experience. A selection of various veg or non-veg dishes are served on a platter, accompanied by rice and roti. The idea behind a Thali is to offer six different flavors of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent, and spicy on one single plate. Many local spots offer a thali lunch for less than $2/person.</p>

      <p>The most popular street food in India, Chaat is a savory snack, typically served as a hors d'oeuvre at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts. With origins from the state of Uttar Pradesh, chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of India.

Sampling local dishes is an important part of experiencing and even understanding a new culture. Food is often a tradition, an identity, and a connection to a community. Indian food has become increasingly popular around the world, but nothing quite compares to authentic food and spices across the subcontinent. Here are 10 of our favorite foods that every traveler must try in North India.
<br>
Samosa

Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack. They are fried or baked with a savory filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, or lentils. Indian samosas are usually vegetarian and often accompanied by mint chutney.

Chole Bhature

A popular dish for breakfast, it is a combination of chick peas in a spicy gravy with fried bread. Our favorite Delhi spot for Chole Bhature is Chacha di Hatti in Kamla Nagar. Lines start early and there are only two tables without chairs, so be prepared to eat standing up (like a local) or take it elsewhere to enjoy.

Rogan Josh

Rogan Josh is an aromatic lamb or goat meat dish from the Kashmir region of India. It is a spicy hot curry usually eaten with naan or rice.

Dal Makhani

    <p class="special_para">The creaminess of coconut milk, freshness of curry leaves, and sharpness of mustard seeds, are some of the peculiar characteristics of south Indian cuisine that made people across the country fall in love with it. Our first preference is to go to a south-Indian restaurant when we decide to eat out. Sadly, it's not possible these days due to lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. While we respect this move that is intended to protect us, we don't know what to do with our overbearing craving for south Indian food. Well, these recipes are just what we need to put our cravings to rest.
      1. RasamThis liquid-y spicy dish tastes almost like sambhar but is much easier to make. Traditionally, rasam is made with toor dal, pepper and tomatoes. You can have it either as a warm, comforting soup or pair it with rice. Rasam is also considered as a great reliever from cold and sore throat.
      2. MicrowaveScared of going near the stove? Make your favourite south Indian sambhar in a microwave! Just assemble all the ingredients - soaked arhar dal, onions, mustard seeds, curry leaves, tamarind pulp, salt, sugar and sambhar masala - and let your sambhar cook in microwave without the need of stirring regularly.
      3. UpmaThis is one of the simplest south Indian dishes, mostly prepared for breakfast. You need urad dal, semolina, curry leaves, coconut paste, tomatoes, vegetables and curd to make it in its authentic form. However, if you want to make it easier for yourself, skip adding coconut masala and tomato masala.
      4. Curd RiceThis south Indian rice preparation is perfect for simple lunch or dinner. Just add milk and curd to leftover rice, add some chopped carrots if you want and garnish it with tempering of curry leaves, mustard seeds, chana dal, urad dal and red chilli.

    The cuisines of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are the spiciest in all of India. Generous use of chili and tamarind make the dishes tangy and hot. The majority of dishes are vegetable- or lentil-based. The hot and spicy dishes are a speciality of the region. Mainly vegetarian dishes are served as part of the cuisine of the region. The uniqueness of Telugu cuisine is that it is a blend of both Hindu as well as Muslim styles of cooking.

Rice is the staple food of the region. Sambar is a special kind of dal prepared in Andhra Pradesh. A traditional Andhra meal comprises five kinds of dishes. To cool the stomach after a spicy meal, curd is served at the end.he three regions of Telugu Land vary in their cuisines. The Telangana region, which shares borders with Central India and Vidharba, has more sorghum- and pearl millet-based rottas in the staple diet.
<br>

The Rayalaseema districts share borders with eastern Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and its cuisine has similarities to that of those regions. The more fertile Andhra coastal region has a long coastline along the Bay of Bengal, and its cuisine has a distinctive flavor with the inclusion of seafood.

Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, has its own characteristic cuisine, which is considerably different from other Telugu cuisines. The Nizams patronise the Hyderabadi cuisine, which is very much like the Nawabi and Lucknowi cuisine. The only difference is that the Nizams of Hyderabad prefer their food to be spicier, resulting in the distinct Hyderabadi cuisine, which includes delicacies like kacche gosht (raw meat) ki biryani, dum ka murgh (chicken cooked in Hyderabadi style), baghara baingan (eggplant).

3.Fast Food
<hr>
<br>
<img src="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover%2Cf=auto%2Conerror=redirect%2Cwidth=867%2Cheight=488/wp-content/uploads/national-fast-food-day.jpg">
<p class="special_para">
  Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on "speed of service" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal. By making the speed of service the priority, this ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant). In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.

The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a customer's arrival (Boston Market rotisserie chicken, Little Caesars pizza, etc.), with waiting time reduced to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily the hamburger outlets (McDonald's, Burger King, etc.) use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) but the hamburgers and french fries are always cooked fresh (or at least relatively recently) and assembled "to order" (like at a diner).

Although a wide variety of food can be "cooked fast", "fast food" is a commercial term-limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away.

Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no shelter or seating, or fast food restaurants (also known as quick service restaurants).Franchise operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.

Fast food began with the first fish and chip shops in Britain in the 1860s.[citation needed] Drive-through restaurants were first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.

Eating fast food has been linked to, among other things, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, insulin resistance conditions and depression. Controlling for other diet and lifestyle confounders of fast food consumers often doesn’t attenuate these associations and it sometimes strengthens the association between fast food consumption and mortality.[9] Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and calories.
